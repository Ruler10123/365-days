# When I Feel Like Playing Tetris or Brawl Stars Menu:
- Open `365-commits`, do a 5-min code warmup file (no goal, just play)
- Watch one YouTube video on a random CS topic and write 2 takeaways
- Add a tool/idea to my "cool dev resources" Notion page
- Refactor yesterday’s code for fun (even just naming)
- Read through a GitHub repo of someone I admire and steal 1 thing

# Tired but Want to Improve
- Organize one folder in GitHub
- Browse Hacker News or Indie Hackers for one good idea
- Copy and paste one code snippet from a past project into your “Snippets Vault”
- Write one thing I learned this week in a public log
- Screenshot cool UI and throw in design inspo folder

# Things I Want To Do
- Learn out tech stack for Aggie Events Codebase
- PostgresSQL, Docker, Tailwind CSS, Next.js (I want to learn the useEffect things and how everything actually comes together)
- Three.js stuff
- Calendar/event syncing prototype - After exams :/
- LangChain/Arize AI magic mix :>
- I want to build a model ground up sometime
